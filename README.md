## generativeAI Application 
The project's name is generativeAI built using MIT app Inventor whose soul funtion is to send prompt to OpenAi's API to get visuals of the given prompt.This project was created for educational purpose and to learn about how API works.
# DALL-E2 API

DALL路E2 is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. It builds upon its predecessor, DALL路E, and extends its capabilities to generate images from textual descriptions. The DALL路E2 API allows developers to interact with this powerful model programmatically.

The DALL路E2 API can be used in various applications and creative projects. Some potential use cases include:

Content Generation: Developers can use the API to automatically generate images for websites, blogs, articles, or social media posts based on text descriptions. This can save time and effort in manually searching for or creating relevant images.

Design and Concept Art: Artists, designers, and creative professionals can use the API to quickly visualize their ideas by providing textual descriptions of scenes, characters, or objects. It can assist in the rapid prototyping of visual concepts.

I created an application in MIT app Inventor and integrated this api to generate visual graphics.
